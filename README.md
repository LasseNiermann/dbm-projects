## **Notes**    

1. This requires [DBM 1.8.8 Mods](https://github.com/Discord-Bot-Maker-Mods/DBM-Mods/tree/master), and [the Beta Client of DBM](https://discordapp.com/channels/374961173524643843/375701228111527937/461267260234006531).
2. To expand upon it, please be sure you thoroughly understand what is going on within the code.
3. Please remember to edit `Line #1` with the role name and `Line #2` with the verification channel in `verify_cmd.js`.
4. This will automatically delete the command message, so the channel will remain entirely clean from the command being spammed.
5. Edit `Line #6` and `Line #7` with the appropriate information in `check_verify_event.js`.
