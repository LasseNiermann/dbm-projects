# Discord Bot Maker Projects    
This will be where I upload and keep track of various bits of Raw Data and projects I create for the DBM Network.    

### Singular Raw Data Codes
This will contain single bits of Raw Data.

* **[Verify Command](https://github.com/zachdoug24/dbm-projects/tree/verify)** - This allows a user to get a code issued to them that they must verify in the appropriate channel.

### Raw Data Packs
The following links contain more than one command.

* **[Advanced Application System](https://google.com/)** - This is my advanced ticket system for Discord Bot Maker, which allows a user to effectively use Support Tickets in their server.
