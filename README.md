## **Notes**    

1. This requires [DBM 1.8.8 Mods](https://github.com/Discord-Bot-Maker-Mods/DBM-Mods/tree/master), [Await Response Call Action Mod](https://discordapp.com/channels/374961173524643843/382056590892728331/454449492972929024) and [the Beta Client of DBM](https://discordapp.com/channels/374961173524643843/375701228111527937/461267260234006531).
2. You either have to run the Support Setup command, or create the following:
    * Role: `Support Team`
    * Category: `Tickets`
    * Text-Channel: `ticket-logs` underneath the Tickets category.

## **Syntax**
`new <reason>` or `ticket <reason>` - Creates a new ticket for the user.    
`close` or `closeticket` - Closes the ticket channel after 15 minutes without interruptions.    
`forceclose` or `forcecloseticket` - Allows a member with the designated role to immediately close tickets.    
`add` or `addticket <user>` - Adds the mentioned user to the ticket the command is issued in.

## **Disclaimer** 
If you have issues with the code, **_do not ping me right off the bat or DM me._** It's nothing but an annoyance. Just ask in [the Support Channel for the Raw Data Server](https://discordapp.com/channels/379372685182107669/388055603320324116/) and someone will assist you. You are also capable of leaving a comment here and I'll get back to you. You can also create an Issue with the Project `Advanced Ticket System`.
